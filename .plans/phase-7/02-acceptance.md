# Phase 7 Acceptance

- Reporting schema (reports, signatures, audit metadata, defects/remedials linkage) migrates successfully.
- API can create/read/sign reports and log audit events.
- Defects CRUD and remedial logging work with job/asset/entity linkage.
- UI surfaces report generation, viewing (client/internal), signing, and defect management with empty/loading/error states.
- Automated tests cover report payload persistence, signature hashing, required-entity warnings, and defects CRUD.
