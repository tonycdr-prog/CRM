# Phase 2 Acceptance Criteria

- Sidebar → widget mapping exists for every sidebar item and applies default params from the registry.
- "Add to dashboard" is available from sidebar entries and persists via existing layout APIs without schema/UI redesigns.
- Tests cover mapping resolution, default param application, and add-to-dashboard flows.
- Docs in `.plans/phase-2/*` are populated, and changes are noted in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Lint and tests pass per the Definition of Done.
