# Phase 2 Scope

Phase 2 focuses solely on sidebar widgetization: mapping every sidebar item to a dashboard-safe widget, exposing an add-to-dashboard action, and proving the mapping with tests. No dashboard schema or UI redesigns are in scope.

Key outcomes:
- Canonical sidebar → widget mapping with defaults.
- Add-to-dashboard action wired through existing layout APIs.
- Tests covering mapping and add-to-dashboard flows.
- Planning, acceptance, and testing notes recorded for Phase 2.
