# Phase 3 Scope

- Implement forms core (form builder + runtime) for Life Safety OPS CRM.
- Add versioned form templates and entity definitions with per-version immutability once published.
- Provide minimal UI for back office creation and runtime submission/answering.
- Introduce persistence (migration + schema) and API coverage for templates, versions, entities, and submissions.
- Add automated tests for form flows and document progress in planning docs only for this phase.
