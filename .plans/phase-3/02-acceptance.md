# Phase 3 Acceptance Criteria

- Migration defines templates, versions, entity templates, submissions, and entity instances with timestamps and created_by fields.
- API enforces immutability of published/used versions and correct submission status transitions.
- UI supports creating templates/versions/entities and running submissions with save/submit capabilities plus empty/loading/error states.
- Tests pass for template->version->entity creation, submission answer/submit flow, and publish edit rejection.
- CHANGELOG updated and planning docs completed for this phase only.
