# Phase 1 Scope

Phase 1 introduces the foundational dashboard platform without sidebar integration. Work is limited to the widget contract/registry, per-user layout persistence, and a minimal dashboard UI for adding, arranging, and saving widgets.

Key outcomes:
- Widget contract and registry defined for reusable dashboard widgets.
- Dashboard layouts stored per user with create/update/load/default APIs.
- Basic dashboard UI that handles empty state, widget add/move/resize, and layout save.
- Planning, acceptance, and testing notes recorded for Phase 1.
