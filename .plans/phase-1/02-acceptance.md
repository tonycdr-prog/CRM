# Phase 1 Acceptance Criteria

- Widget contract exposes widgetId, typed params schema, permissions hook, and refresh policy.
- Widget registry supports register/get/list and includes at least one default widget.
- Dashboard layouts persist per user via create/update/load and default-selection APIs backed by storage.
- Dashboard UI handles empty state, adding widgets from the registry, reordering/resizing, and saving layouts.
- Automated tests cover widget registry behavior and dashboard layout persistence APIs.
- Changes respect AGENTS.md guardrails and update the changelog.
