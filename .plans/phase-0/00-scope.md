# Phase 0 Scope

Phase 0 sets baseline guardrails for the Life Safety OPS CRM repo. Work here only establishes documentation, commands, seeds, and a minimal happy-path test without feature refactors.

Key outcomes:
- Repository guardrails recorded (AGENTS.md).
- Commands for dev/test/lint/db flows documented.
- Planning, acceptance, and testing notes captured for Phase 0.
- Seed data and one happy-path test in place for a tiny slice.
