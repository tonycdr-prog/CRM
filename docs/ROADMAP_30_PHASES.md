# Deucalion 30-Phase Proposal (Ethos-Aligned)

This roadmap is the implementation guide for Deucalion. Each phase anchors to the ethos pillars and should be referenced when planning or shipping future work.

## Ethos Anchors
- Foundational before clever
- Clarity over automation
- Evidence-first compliance
- Human judgment stays in the loop
- Modular by design
- Composable workspaces
- Progressive intelligence
- Calm systems for critical work

## Language Note
- "Golden Thread" remains the feature name.
- "Golden Weave" refers to the linking of systems (jobs, assets, forms, defects, reports) that create the thread.

## Phase Plan

1) CRM Truth Layer
- Goal: normalize jobs/sites/assets/people relationships.
- Ethos: Foundational before clever.

2) Evidence Spine
- Goal: unify event log and linked artifacts.
- Ethos: Evidence-first compliance.

3) Golden Thread UI
- Goal: timeline on key entities with evidence hops.
- Ethos: Clarity over automation.

4) Module Gate UX
- Goal: visible module states and rationale in context.
- Ethos: Modular by design.

5) Dashboard v1
- Goal: widget registry and saved layouts per user.
- Ethos: Composable workspaces.

6) Widget Chrome
- Goal: consistent controls, pop-out, expand, refresh.
- Ethos: Composable workspaces.

7) Forms Engine v1
- Goal: repeat-per-asset packs with rules.
- Ethos: Evidence-first compliance.

8) Calibration Binding
- Goal: instrument linkage and enforcement rules.
- Ethos: Human judgment stays in the loop.

9) Compliance Snapshot
- Goal: read-only risk surface (missing/overdue/conflicts).
- Ethos: Clarity over automation.

10) Reporting v1
- Goal: evidence-linked outputs and summaries.
- Ethos: Evidence-first compliance.

11) Defects Chain
- Goal: Defect -> Quote -> Remedial Job linking.
- Ethos: Evidence-first compliance.

12) Scheduling v1
- Goal: manual scheduling with conflict warnings.
- Ethos: Clarity over automation.

13) Scheduling v2
- Goal: explainable scoring and why-this-assignment panels.
- Ethos: Human judgment stays in the loop.

14) Forms Builder UX
- Goal: template editor with rules and calculated fields.
- Ethos: Foundational before clever.

15) Asset Library
- Goal: structured asset types and lineage.
- Ethos: Evidence-first compliance.

16) Insight Lens v1
- Goal: read-only insight cards with evidence links.
- Ethos: Progressive intelligence.

17) Insight Lens v2
- Goal: optional suggestions only, no automation.
- Ethos: Human judgment stays in the loop.

18) Search v1
- Goal: Postgres trigram search for quick access.
- Ethos: Clarity over automation.

19) Companion PWA v1
- Goal: offline cache and delta sync.
- Ethos: Calm systems for critical work.

20) Companion Forms Runner
- Goal: offline submissions with conflict notices.
- Ethos: Evidence-first compliance.

21) Companion Defects Capture
- Goal: photo evidence and asset-linked defects.
- Ethos: Evidence-first compliance.

22) Companion Bulk Asset Linking
- Goal: bulk add assets to jobs in field.
- Ethos: Composable workspaces.

23) Golden Weave Narrative
- Goal: copy and UI cues that explain linking context.
- Ethos: Clarity over automation.

24) Module Presets
- Goal: role/team default boards and widgets.
- Ethos: Composable workspaces.

25) Audit Export v1
- Goal: export evidence packs with filters.
- Ethos: Evidence-first compliance.

26) Multi-Screen Ops
- Goal: send-to-screen workflows and views.
- Ethos: Calm systems for critical work.

27) Observability v1
- Goal: logs, performance budgets, and diagnostics.
- Ethos: Foundational before clever.

28) Security Hardening v2
- Goal: privilege audits and access reports.
- Ethos: Evidence-first compliance.

29) Data Stewardship v1
- Goal: retention policies and redaction controls.
- Ethos: Human judgment stays in the loop.

30) Trusted Intelligence v1
- Goal: validated recommendations with opt-in.
- Ethos: Progressive intelligence.

## Usage
- Reference this file when planning or implementing phases.
- Do not jump ahead of the ethos constraints (clarity and evidence first).
- New features must map to a phase and ethos pillar before implementation.
