- Added a development-only auth bypass flag to run the app locally without OIDC discovery.
- Added a database-optional dev preview path that boots with in-memory sessions/layouts when DEV_AUTH_BYPASS is enabled without a database.
- Added SPA fallback routing and a dev-only Review sidebar section to preview new pages together.
- Loosened CSP directives in development to allow Vite/react-refresh while keeping production directives strict.
- Added shared schedule schemas (Zod) to mirror the scheduling migration and ensure assignments carry aligned start/ends metadata.
- Added dashboard widget chrome actions (expand, pop-out, send-to-screen, refresh) and an edit mode with drag, resize, duplicate, and save for per-user layouts.
 - Expanded the dev preview path to surface review-mode status (including DB availability) via `/api/dev/status` and sidebar
   flags while keeping production auth/CSP unchanged.
 - Ensured production CSP keeps strict connect-src while development explicitly allows websocket/inlined scripts for Vite.
- Refined the development preview path with memory-backed dev auth, environment-aware CSP helpers, SPA accept-header checks, and a dev flag banner plus tests.
- Added a guarded `/api/dev/seed-demo` endpoint to seed demo data when a database is available under `SEED_DEMO=true`.
- Grouped the defects UI by job with friendlier unauthorized messaging to aid review of defect workflows in preview mode.
- Added a global dev review banner to surface auth/review/database flags during preview sessions.
- Introduced a reusable widget chrome with expand/new-tab controls and a standalone widget view route.
- Added a schedule service with in-memory assignments, duplication, and conflict detection plus API tests for create/update/duplicate flows.
- Rebuilt the schedule page with calendar and gantt drag/drop, shift-duplicate, resize, conflict warnings, and engineer selection for duplicates.
- Refreshed the schedule board with per-engineer drag-and-drop swimlanes, shift-duplicate support, and friendlier auth/conflict handling for preview.
- Added a scheduling assignments migration to persist job-to-engineer windows with indexed lookups for conflict detection.
- Updated the shared schedule assignment table mapping to use UUID columns and indexed builders consistent with the migration schema.
- Reworked schedule routes to persist assignments against the database when available while retaining the in-memory dev fallback and refreshed API tests.
- Introduced Life Safety Ops module framing with module constants, sidebar grouping, a review banner tagline, and supporting documentation.
- Added a module registry with env-driven enablement, dev status surfacing, and client hooks so modules can be toggled without impacting CRM core routes.
- Expanded module placeholders (reporting, asset management, compliance, forms engine) and added module gating with a friendly disabled state.
- Declared @dnd-kit dependencies to support dashboard and scheduling drag-and-drop interactions.
- Pinned npm installs to the public registry via `.npmrc` for consistent dependency resolution in dev environments.
- Registered an upcoming-schedule dashboard widget with standard chrome actions to align with new widget key constants.
