Implement Forms inside Field Companion (engineer mode) on the Job Detail page.

Context
- Companion routes now work and mode auto-syncs.
- Companion job detail page is: client/src/pages/field-job-detail.tsx
- We want a new Forms section/button that launches a Forms screen/panel for the job.

REQUIREMENTS

1) UI placement + visibility
- In client/src/pages/field-job-detail.tsx, add a clear button or tab: “Forms”.
- It must only be visible/active when view mode is engineer/companion (use the existing view mode hook).
- Clicking it navigates to a new route like:
  /field-companion/jobs/:jobId/forms
  using centralized ROUTES constants from client/src/lib/routes.ts.

2) Forms screen behaviour
Create a new page (or component) for the job forms screen:
- Title: “Forms”
- First control: System selector dropdown (site systems)
- When system selected, show available forms/templates:
  - If system is MSHEV → show “Damper Testing” template (from DB/API)
  - If system is Pressurisation → show “Pressure Differential Testing” template (from DB/API)
  - Also show any other templates mapped to that system
- Nothing should be hardcoded in UI other than labels; templates come from API/DB.

3) API calls (stub if backend not ready yet)
If backend endpoints aren’t implemented yet, create temporary mocked responses behind a clearly marked dev flag, but structure the UI to call these endpoints:
- GET  /api/jobs/:jobId/forms
  returns { systemTypes: [...], templates: [...] }
- POST /api/inspections
  creates/returns inspectionInstanceId
- GET  /api/inspections/:id
  returns template structure + prior responses
- POST /api/inspections/:id/responses
  append-only save
- POST /api/inspections/:id/complete
  mark complete

If backend exists, integrate for real.

4) Rendering rules (dynamic form renderer)
Build a small renderer that can display:
- Entity blocks (heading + description)
- Rows as inputs:
  - pass/fail
  - numeric with units
  - text
  - choice
- Each row supports optional:
  - comment
  - “evidence required” flag (UI indicator only for now if uploads not built)

5) Save + resume
- Responses should autosave (debounced) OR have a Save button minimum.
- User can leave and come back; it should reload previously saved responses.

6) Completion + locking
- “Complete Form” button marks inspection complete.
- Once complete, inputs become read-only.

ENGINEERING CONSTRAINTS
- Use centralized routes from client/src/lib/routes.ts (no hardcoded strings).
- Keep state stable: don’t tie mode switching to forms state.
- Keep UI simple and correct; no drag/drop builder yet.

OUTPUT REQUIRED
After implementation provide:
1) Exact files created/changed
2) What route(s) were added
3) Manual test steps:
   - open job → Forms → select system → open template → enter values → save → refresh → values persist → complete locks

PROCESS
Start by listing your plan + file changes, then implement.
