Fix my Field Companion navigation + viewing mode. Current behaviour:
	•	“Companion” means Field Companion
	•	Clicking Field Companion in the left sidebar currently does nothing / doesn’t route correctly
	•	There is a top-right toggle that lets Back Office users “view companion”

Goal
Make Field Companion accessible reliably in two ways:
	1.	Clicking “Field Companion” in the sidebar always navigates to the Companion area
	2.	The top-right toggle switches the app between Back Office UI and Companion UI, and navigation stays consistent

Requirements
	1.	Identify why sidebar click doesn’t work (wrong route, missing router link, blocked by auth/role guard, route not registered, stale state, etc.) and fix it.
	2.	Define a single “mode” state, e.g. appMode = "backOffice" | "companion", stored in a global place (context/store) AND persisted (localStorage) so refresh keeps the chosen mode.
	3.	When appMode is "companion":
	•	Sidebar should highlight Field Companion
	•	Default route should go to the Companion landing screen
	•	Back Office-only pages should either hide or show a friendly “Switch to Back Office” message
	4.	When appMode is "backOffice":
	•	Default route goes to the back office dashboard
	•	Companion routes remain reachable only when toggled on (or still reachable but not shown—choose a consistent policy and implement it)
	5.	Do not break deep links: if user goes directly to a Companion URL and appMode is backOffice, either auto-switch mode or show a prompt to switch (pick one behaviour and implement it consistently).
	6.	Update any route guards so field companion pages are accessible to the correct users (authenticated users; optionally role-based if you already have roles).
	7.	Provide a clear list of files changed and manual test steps:
	•	sidebar click works
	•	toggle switches UI and routes correctly
	•	refresh preserves mode
	•	deep link behaviour works

Important
	•	Do not hardcode magic URLs in multiple places—centralize routes in one router config.
	•	Keep the toggle logic and router behaviour deterministic (no flaky state).

Start by listing: (a) current routes, (b) where the sidebar items are defined, (c) where the toggle is implemented, (d) the proposed solution. Then implement.
